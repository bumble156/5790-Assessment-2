NetLogo Model of Social Corruption Version 1.0 26/04/2017

This NetLogo project contains a model of social corruption based
on the model proposed by Ross Hammond [2000]. The model creates 
homogenous populations of citizens and bureaucrats and has them
play a simulated game. Each agent has the option of acting in an
honest or corrupt manner, with the decision for which action to 
choose being determined by an agents memory, social network and
predisposition to honesty. Corrupt agents risk jail time in 
return for higher payoffs. Through this, the model attempts to 
show changes in social behaviour and shifting levels of 
corruption within a society.

The model was created as part of the Leeds University MSc GIS 
Advanced Programming, assignment 2 and was programmed using 
NetLogo 6.0.1.
